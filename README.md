# VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild
[Demo](https://jasonppy.github.io/VoiceCraft_web) [Paper](https://jasonppy.github.io/assets/pdfs/VoiceCraft.pdf)


### TL;DR
VoiceCraft is a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both **speech editing** and **zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS)** on in-the-wild data including audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts.

To clone or edit an unseen voice, VoiceCraft needs only a few seconds of reference.

## News
:star: 03/28/2024: Model weights are up on HuggingFaceðŸ¤— [here](https://huggingface.co/pyp1/VoiceCraft/tree/main)!

## TODO
- [x] Codebase upload
- [x] Environment setup
- [x] Inference demo for speech editing and TTS
- [x] Training guidance
- [x] RealEdit dataset and training manifest
- [x] Model weights (both 330M and 830M, the former seems to be just as good)
- [ ] Write colab notebooks for better hands-on experience
- [ ] HuggingFace Spaces demo
- [ ] Better guidance on training

## How to run TTS inference 
There are two ways: 
1. with docker. see [quickstart](#quickstart)
2. without docker. see [envrionment setup](#environment-setup)

When you are inside the docker image or you have installed all dependencies, Checkout [`inference_tts.ipynb`](./inference_tts.ipynb).

## QuickStart
:star: To try out TTS inference with VoiceCraft, the best way is using docker. Thank [@ubergarm](https://github.com/ubergarm) and [@jayc88](https://github.com/jay-c88) for making this happen. 

Tested on Linux and Windows and should work with any host with docker installed.
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo in a directory on a drive with plenty of free space and switch the current working directory to the cloned one 
git clone git@github.com:jasonppy/VoiceCraft.git
cd VoiceCraft

# 2. Assuming you have docker installed with nvidia container container-toolkit (windows has this built into the driver)
# https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/1.13.5/install-guide.html
# sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit-base || yay -Syu nvidia-container-toolkit || echo etc...

# 3. Try to start an existing container otherwise create a new one passing in all GPUs
./start-jupyter.sh  # linux
start-jupyter.bat   # windows

# 4. Now open a webpage on the host box to the URL shown at the bottom of:
docker logs jupyter

# 5. Optionally look inside from another terminal
docker exec -it jupyter /bin/bash
export USER=(your_linux_username_used_above)
export HOME=/home/$USER
sudo apt-get update

# 6. Confirm video card(s) are visible inside container
nvidia-smi

# 7. Now in the browser, open inference_tts.ipynb and work through one cell at a time
echo GOOD LUCK
```

## Environment setup
```bash
conda create -n voicecraft python=3.9.16
conda activate voicecraft

pip install torch==2.0.1 # this assumes your system is compatible with CUDA 11.7, otherwise checkout https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v201
apt-get install ffmpeg # if you don't already have ffmpeg installed
pip install -e git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft.git@c5157b5bf14bf83449c17ea1eeb66c19fb4bc7f0#egg=audiocraft
apt-get install espeak-ng # backend for the phonemizer installed below
pip install tensorboard==2.16.2
pip install phonemizer==3.2.1
pip install torchaudio==2.0.2
pip install datasets==2.16.0
pip install torchmetrics==0.11.1
# install MFA for getting forced-alignment, this could take a few minutes
conda install -c conda-forge montreal-forced-aligner=2.2.17 openfst=1.8.2 kaldi=5.5.1068
# conda install pocl # above gives an warning for installing pocl, not sure if really need this

# to run ipynb
conda install -n voicecraft ipykernel --update-deps --force-reinstall
```

If you have encountered version issues when running things, checkout [environment.yml](./environment.yml) for exact matching.

## Inference Examples
Checkout [`inference_speech_editing.ipynb`](./inference_speech_editing.ipynb) and [`inference_tts.ipynb`](./inference_tts.ipynb)

## Training
To train an VoiceCraft model, you need to prepare the following parts: 
1. utterances and their transcripts
2. encode the utterances into codes using e.g. Encodec
3. convert transcripts into phoneme sequence, and a phoneme set (we named it vocab.txt)
4. manifest (i.e. metadata)

Step 1,2,3 are handled in [./data/phonemize_encodec_encode_hf.py](./data/phonemize_encodec_encode_hf.py), where 
1. Gigaspeech is downloaded through HuggingFace. Note that you need to sign an agreement in order to download the dataset (it needs your auth token)
2. phoneme sequence and encodec codes are also extracted using the script.

An example run:

```bash
conda activate voicecraft
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
cd ./data
python phonemize_encodec_encode_hf.py \
--dataset_size xs \
--download_to path/to/store_huggingface_downloads \
--save_dir path/to/store_extracted_codes_and_phonemes \
--encodec_model_path path/to/encodec_model \
--mega_batch_size 120 \
--batch_size 32 \
--max_len 30000
```
where encodec_model_path is avaliable [here](https://huggingface.co/pyp1/VoiceCraft). This model is trained on Gigaspeech XL, it has 56M parameters, 4 codebooks, each codebook has 2048 codes. Details are described in our [paper](https://jasonppy.github.io/assets/pdfs/VoiceCraft.pdf). If you encounter OOM during extraction, try decrease the batch_size and/or max_len.
The extracted codes, phonemes, and vocab.txt will be stored at `path/to/store_extracted_codes_and_phonemes/${dataset_size}/{encodec_16khz_4codebooks,phonemes,vocab.txt}`.

As for manifest, please download train.txt and validation.txt from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pyp1/VoiceCraft_RealEdit/tree/main), and put them under `path/to/store_extracted_codes_and_phonemes/manifest/`. Please also download vocab.txt from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pyp1/VoiceCraft_RealEdit/tree/main) if you want to use our pretrained VoiceCraft model (so that the phoneme-to-token matching is the same). 

Now, you are good to start training!

```bash
conda activate voicecraft
cd ./z_scripts
bash e830M.sh
```

<!-- How to use g2p to convert english text into IPA phoneme sequence
first install it with `pip install g2p`
```python
from g2p import make_g2p
transducer = make_g2p('eng', 'eng-ipa')
transducer("hello").output_string 
# it will output: 'hÊŒloÊŠ'
``` -->
