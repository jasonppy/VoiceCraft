### TL;DR
VoiceCraft is a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both **speech editing** and **zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS)** on in-the-wild data including audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts.

To clone or edit an unseen voice, VoiceCraft needs only a few seconds of reference.

## How to run inference
There are three ways (besides running Gradio in Colab):

1. More flexible inference beyond Gradio UI in Google Colab. see [quickstart colab](#quickstart-colab)
2. with docker. see [quickstart docker](#quickstart-docker)
3. without docker. see [environment setup](#environment-setup). You can also run gradio locally if you choose this option
4. As a standalone script that you can easily integrate into other projects.
see [quickstart command line](#quickstart-command-line).

When you are inside the docker image or you have installed all dependencies, Checkout [`inference_tts.ipynb`](./inference_tts.ipynb).

If you want to do model development such as training/finetuning, I recommend following [envrionment setup](#environment-setup) and [training](#training).

## News
:star: 04/22/2024: 330M/830M TTS Enhanced Models are up [here](https://huggingface.co/pyp1), load them through [`gradio_app.py`](./gradio_app.py) or [`inference_tts.ipynb`](./inference_tts.ipynb)! Replicate demo is up, major thanks to [@chenxwh](https://github.com/chenxwh)!

:star: 04/11/2024: VoiceCraft Gradio is now available on HuggingFace Spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pyp1/VoiceCraft_gradio)! Major thanks to [@zuev-stepan](https://github.com/zuev-stepan), [@Sewlell](https://github.com/Sewlell), [@pgsoar](https://github.com/pgosar) [@Ph0rk0z](https://github.com/Ph0rk0z).

:star: 04/05/2024: I finetuned giga330M with the TTS objective on gigaspeech and 1/5 of librilight. Weights are [here](https://huggingface.co/pyp1/VoiceCraft/tree/main). Make sure maximal prompt + generation length <= 16 seconds (due to our limited compute, we had to drop utterances longer than 16s in training data). Even stronger models forthcomming, stay tuned!

:star: 03/28/2024: Model weights for giga330M and giga830M are up on HuggingFaceðŸ¤— [here](https://huggingface.co/pyp1/VoiceCraft/tree/main)!

## QuickStart Colab

:star: To try out speech editing or TTS Inference with VoiceCraft, the simplest way is using Google Colab.
Instructions to run are on the Colab itself.

1. To try [Speech Editing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FV7EC36dl8UioePY1xXijXTMl7X47kR_?usp=sharing)
2. To try [TTS Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lch_6it5-JpXgAQlUTRRI2z2_rk5K67Z?usp=sharing)

## QuickStart Command Line

:star: To use it as a standalone script, check out tts_demo.py and speech_editing_demo.py.
Be sure to first [setup your environment](#environment-setup).
Without arguments, they will run the standard demo arguments used as an example elsewhere
in this repository. You can use the command line arguments to specify unique input audios,
target transcripts, and inference hyperparameters. Run the help command for more information:
`python3 tts_demo.py -h`

## QuickStart Docker
:star: To try out TTS inference with VoiceCraft, you can also use docker. Thank [@ubergarm](https://github.com/ubergarm) and [@jayc88](https://github.com/jay-c88) for making this happen.

Tested on Linux and Windows and should work with any host with docker installed.
```bash
# 1. clone the repo on in a directory on a drive with plenty of free space
git clone git@github.com:jasonppy/VoiceCraft.git
cd VoiceCraft

# 2. assumes you have docker installed with nvidia container container-toolkit (windows has this built into the driver)
# https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/1.13.5/install-guide.html
# sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit-base || yay -Syu nvidia-container-toolkit || echo etc...

# 3. First build the docker image
docker build --tag "voicecraft" .

# 4. Try to start an existing container otherwise create a new one passing in all GPUs
./start-jupyter.sh  # linux
start-jupyter.bat   # windows

# 5. now open a webpage on the host box to the URL shown at the bottom of:
docker logs jupyter

# 6. optionally look inside from another terminal
docker exec -it jupyter /bin/bash
export USER=(your_linux_username_used_above)
export HOME=/home/$USER
sudo apt-get update

# 7. confirm video card(s) are visible inside container
nvidia-smi

# 8. Now in browser, open inference_tts.ipynb and work through one cell at a time
echo GOOD LUCK
```

Long TTS mode: Easy TTS on long texts


## Training
To train an VoiceCraft model, you need to prepare the following parts:
1. utterances and their transcripts
2. encode the utterances into codes using e.g. Encodec
3. convert transcripts into phoneme sequence, and a phoneme set (we named it vocab.txt)
4. manifest (i.e. metadata)

Step 1,2,3 are handled in [./data/phonemize_encodec_encode_hf.py](./data/phonemize_encodec_encode_hf.py), where
1. Gigaspeech is downloaded through HuggingFace. Note that you need to sign an agreement in order to download the dataset (it needs your auth token)
2. phoneme sequence and encodec codes are also extracted using the script.

An example run:

```bash
conda activate voicecraft
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
cd ./data
python phonemize_encodec_encode_hf.py \
--dataset_size xs \
--download_to path/to/store_huggingface_downloads \
--save_dir path/to/store_extracted_codes_and_phonemes \
--encodec_model_path path/to/encodec_model \
--mega_batch_size 120 \
--batch_size 32 \
--max_len 30000
```
where encodec_model_path is avaliable [here](https://huggingface.co/pyp1/VoiceCraft). This model is trained on Gigaspeech XL, it has 56M parameters, 4 codebooks, each codebook has 2048 codes. Details are described in our [paper](https://jasonppy.github.io/assets/pdfs/VoiceCraft.pdf). If you encounter OOM during extraction, try decrease the batch_size and/or max_len.
The extracted codes, phonemes, and vocab.txt will be stored at `path/to/store_extracted_codes_and_phonemes/${dataset_size}/{encodec_16khz_4codebooks,phonemes,vocab.txt}`.

As for manifest, please download train.txt and validation.txt from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pyp1/VoiceCraft_RealEdit/tree/main), and put them under `path/to/store_extracted_codes_and_phonemes/manifest/`. Please also download vocab.txt from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pyp1/VoiceCraft_RealEdit/tree/main) if you want to use our pretrained VoiceCraft model (so that the phoneme-to-token matching is the same).

Now, you are good to start training!

```bash
conda activate voicecraft
cd ./z_scripts
bash e830M.sh
```

It's the same procedure to prepare your own custom dataset. Make sure that if

## Finetuning
You also need to do step 1-4 as Training, and I recommend to use AdamW for optimization if you finetune a pretrained model for better stability. checkout script `./z_scripts/e830M_ft.sh`.

If your dataset introduce new phonemes (which is very likely) that doesn't exist in the giga checkpoint, make sure you combine the original phonemes with the phoneme from your data when construction vocab. And you need to adjust `--text_vocab_size` and `--text_pad_token` so that the former is bigger than or equal to you vocab size, and the latter has the same value as `--text_vocab_size` (i.e. `--text_pad_token` is always the last token). Also since the text embedding are now of a different size, make sure you modify the weights loading part so that I won't crash (you could skip loading `text_embedding` or only load the existing part, and randomly initialize the new)
